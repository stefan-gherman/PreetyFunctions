<p>The purpose of this collection is to improve the quality of life for the users, myself and other Codecoolers during development.</p>
<h3>Scripts</h3>
<h4>PreetyNumber</h4>
<ul>

<p>PreetyNumber is a script that takes an integer as input and based on the number of digits and returns it in a more readable format:<br><br>Example: 102356 will be 102K<br><br>The main usage for this can for websites that count views, our apps that deal with large numbers but have little display room.<br>The maximum number for which the function works is 999 Quintillion, meaning a number consisting of 21 digits. The limit may be adjusted in the future.</p>
